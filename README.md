When reusing code, the final file must include some mention of the codes original author in a comment. This could be along the line of "By: Aaron", "Original code by: Aaron", or even just "AaronRuinsLives". Anything along those lines works as long as it includes the name. You can use Aaron or AaronRuinsLives as the name.
You can also instead include the credit anywhere in the mods description if you would rather do that
You can also contact me if you want express permission to reuse the code, help understanding how it works, or wish to exclude the credit from your project. You can contact me from anywhere below

As long as the rules regarding credits are followed, you are allowed to reuse, alter, and repost any part of the mod you wish. If you want you could make your own door resprite mod by altering the sprites and animation a little, thats totally fine. The code should be pretty well documented in its comments. Thats should be all!
